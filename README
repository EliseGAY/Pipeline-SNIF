# Aim : 
#------#
Run SNIF for demographic inference 
Demographic inferences made by assuming that the individuals came from a structured population and compare the results to the PSMC plot

# Input :
#----------#
PSMC output

# Methods :
#----------#
This pipeline here is made to provide usable script to run SNIF on the cluster
Adatped for PSL cluster with SLURM command

How to run the script on the cluster : 
Fill the parameter in the python script "snif.py"
sbatch run_snif.sh

Remarks :
For each given component and distance, the program will test different parameters n,M,t etc. and decide for which parameter the demographic inference best matches the output of PSMC
According to the author the graphics have to be analyzed manually to select the best inference from SNIF.

# output :
#----------#

Files :
    .curve.csv :
	d_omega / d_visuel
	inf.n = nb of infered DEME
	inf.t = Time of the mutation rate changes.
	inf.M = Migration rate for each 'c'
	inf.S = DEME size
	inf.N.Ref = Sum of all individu (?)

    .csv :
	Times = Times (multiply per 'g')
	sources = Ne from PSMC
	infered = Infered Ne
